## the second function detect whether inverse has been calculated, if so, return the cached value and miss calculation; if not, calculate it.

## the function creates a special object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}



##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by  makeCacheMatrix  above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then  cacheSolve  should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cachesolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$get()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
